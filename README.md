## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development.
Prerequisites

    Node.js (v20 or newer)

    pnpm (or npm/yarn)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiegoxK/clone-hero-theme-editor.git
cd clone-hero-theme-editor
```

### Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## üìã Available Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev: Starts the development server.

pnpm build: Creates a production-ready build of the application.

pnpm start: Starts the production server.

pnpm presets: This is a special build script. It reads all .ini files from src/lib/presets/ini, automatically migrates them to the latest format, and generates a single TypeScript file (src/lib/presets/index.ts) that the application uses for the theme selector dropdown. Run this script whenever you add or change a preset .ini file.
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Plans & TODOs

This project is actively being developed. Here are some of the features and improvements planned for the future:

### Core Editor Features

- [ ] **Complete the Drums Tab:**
  - [ ] Create visual preview components for all drum notes (toms, cymbals, kick).
  - [ ] Implement the corresponding color controls in the sidebar.
- [ ] **Whammy & Sustain Effects:**
  - [ ] Add a toggle to preview the `sustain_sp_phrase` color for whammying star notes.

### Application Infrastructure

- [ ] **User Accounts & Database Storage:**
  - [ ] Implement user authentication (e.g., using NextAuth.js or Clerk).
  - [ ] Set up a database (e.g., Supabase, Vercel Postgres) to save user themes.
  - [ ] Create a "My Themes" page for logged-in users to manage their saved themes.
- [ ] **Community Theme Gallery:**
  - [ ] Develop a public page to browse, search, and filter themes created by the community.
  - [ ] Allow users to "like," clone, and download themes created by others.

## üêû Known Issues & Potential Improvements

This editor aims to be as accurate as possible, but replicating a game engine's rendering perfectly in a web browser its challenging. Here are a few known visual discrepancies where contributions would be highly valued:

- Hit Flame Accuracy: The striker_hit_flame effect is visually functional but isn't a 1:1 match to the in-game appearance.

- Color Blending for Open Notes: The rendered colors for the note_open and striker_hit_flame_open effects are very close but can appear slightly off compared to the game.

**Contributions are welcome! If you're interested in helping with any of these features, please feel free to open an issue to discuss it.**
